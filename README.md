WSU 2020 fall data science project

Background: In the world of soccer, managers are always looking to build the best squads for the team, so they always have their eyes set scouting on the player market in search of an ideal player which suits team’s need and philosophy. And in order to find the missing piece for the puzzle, they are not looking for the most expensive piece but the piece that fits the most in terms of the team’s tactics and playing style. So our group is coming up with a scouting network model that can assist the coach in building the squad in a more intelligent way.

Data: we will be using the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. This dataset contains the seasons of 2008 and 2016, over 25,000 matches and over 10,000 players. The attributes and ratings of teams and players are based on the source of the FIFA video game that was released in the corresponding season, with the inclusion of weekly update, and the lineup squad information from every team.

Methods we plan to develop:  1) Determine whether a certain player is fit to play in a certain league in certain season 2) Generalize a player’s attribute to see if they is capable to play in a team according to that team’s philosophy. 3) Determine whether a team is offense-concentrating or defense-to-fastbreak kind of team. 4) Determine whether a team likes to play long-ball (long passing game) or tiki-taka (short passing game). 5) Visualize the attributes for a certain team or league.
